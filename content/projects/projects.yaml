Soon after Martin started working on a new and improved version, called the Marble Machine X. This build is ongoing and is a collaborative effort of about 20 engineers from all around the world, including me. My part of the job consist of converting the digitally composed music into templates to be put on the machine.

For some parts of the show custom parts were 3D printed, lasercut and combined with Arduino modules and mostly off-the-shelf components. Models were designed with Fusion360 and edited with Inkscape. Parts were printed with an Ultimaker 3 and laser cut with a Trotec Speedy 300."
